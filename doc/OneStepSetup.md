# One-step setup

This is a streamlined process for setting up the Pi. You'll flash a preconfigured version of Raspbian Stretch Lite and then fill out a config file.

## Notes

* Assumes your Pi has access to Wifi, with internet access (during setup). (But all setup methods do currently.) USB networking is still enabled for troubleshooting or manual setup
* This image will work for either _headless_ (tested) or _manual_ (tested less) setup.
* Currently not tested with the rsync/rclone methods when using headless setup, however, you can specify 'none' as the archive method in the config file, which will configure the pi as a wifi-accessible USB drive, so you can then configure rclone/rsync and rerun the setup-teslausb script.

## Configure the SD card before first boot of the Pi

1. Flash the [latest image release](https://github.com/marcone/teslausb/releases) using Etcher or similar.

1. Mount the card again, and in the `boot` directory create a `teslausb_setup_variables.conf` file to export the same environment variables normally needed for manual setup (including archive info, Wifi, and push notifications (if desired).
A sample conf file is located in the `boot` folder on the SD card, but check https://github.com/marcone/teslausb/blob/main-dev/pi-gen-sources/00-teslausb-tweaks/files/teslausb_setup_variables.conf.sample for the latest version of the config file.

    The file should contain the entries below at a minimum, but **replace with your own values**. Be sure that your WiFi SSID and password are properly quoted and/or escaped according to [bash quoting  rules](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Quoting), and that in addition any `&`, `/` and `\` are also escaped by prefixing them with a `\`.
    If the password does not contain a single quote character, you can enclose the entire password in single quotes, like so:
    ```
    export WIFIPASS='password'
    ```
    even if it contains other characters that might otherwise be special to bash, like \\, * and $ (but note that the \\ should still be escaped with an additional \\ in order for the password to be correctly handled).
    
    If the password does contain a single quote, you will need to use a different syntax. E.g. if the password is `pass'word`, you would use:
    ```
    export WIFIPASS=$'pass\'word'
    ```
    and if the password contains both a single quote and a backslash, e.g. `pass'wo\rd`you'd use:
    ``` 
    export WIFIPASS=$'pass\'wo\\rd'
    ```

    Similarly if your WiFi SSID has spaces in its name, make sure they're escaped or quoted.

    For example, if your SSID were
    ```
    Foo Bar 2.4 GHz
    ```
    you would use
    ```
    export SSID=Foo\ Bar\ 2.4\ GHz
    ```
    or
    ```
    export SSID='Foo Bar 2.4 GHz'
    ```
    
    Example file:
    ```
    export ARCHIVE_SYSTEM=cifs
    export archiveserver=Nautilus
    export sharename=SailfishCam
    export shareuser=sailfish
    export sharepassword='pa$$w0rd'
    export camsize=16G
    # SSID of your 2.4 GHz network
    export SSID='your_ssid'
    export WIFIPASS='your_wifi_password'
    export HEADLESS_SETUP=true
    # export REPO=marcone
    # export BRANCH=main-dev
    # By default will use the main repo, but if you've been asked to test the image,
    # these variables should be uncommunted and updated to point to the right repo/branch

    # uncomment to enable a samba server that exports the recordings
    #export SAMBA_ENABLED=true
    # uncomment to enable guest access to the samba server
    #export SAMBA_GUEST=true

    # uncomment to enable teslausb to act as a wifi access point with the given
    # SSID, so you can access it while on the road.
    #export AP_SSID='TESLAUSB WIFI'
    # Change this! The setup script will not accept the default 'password'
    # Also note that the wifi password must be at least 8 characters.
    #export AP_PASS='password'
    # IP address is optional. The AP will give its clients IP addresses in the
    # x.x.x.100-150 range so make sure you don't put the AP's IP address in
    # that range.
    #export AP_IP='192.168.66.1'

    # Set to either an actual timezone, or "auto" to attempt automatic timezone detection.
    # If unset, defaults to the default Raspbian timezone, Europe/London (BST).
    # export timezone=America/Los_Angeles

    # By default there is a 20 second delay between connecting to wifi and
    # starting the archiving of recorded clips. Uncomment this to change
    # the duration of that delay
    # export archivedelay=20

    # export pushover_enabled=false
    # export pushover_user_key=user_key
    # export pushover_app_key=app_key

    # export gotify_enabled=false
    # export gotify_domain=https://gotify.domain.com
    # export gotify_app_token=put_your_token_here
    # export gotify_priority=5

    # export ifttt_enabled=false
    # export ifttt_event_name=put_your_event_name_here
    # export ifttt_key=put_your_key_here

    # export sns_enabled=true
    # export aws_region=us-east-1
    # export aws_access_key_id=put_your_accesskeyid_here
    # export aws_secret_key=put_your_secretkey_here
    # export aws_sns_topic_arn=put_your_sns_topicarn_here

    # TeslaUSB can optionally use the Tesla API to keep your car awake, so it can
    # power the Pi long enough for the archiving process to complete. To enable
    # that, please provide your Tesla account email and password below.
    # TeslaUSB will only send your credentials to the Tesla API itself.
    #
    # NOTE:  if you do this, it's highly recommended that you set up 'PIN to Drive'
    #   as if the Pi or the car is stolen, the thief has access to your Tesla account 
    #   and could change the password, add their own devices as a key, steal the car,
    #   etc.  If either is stolen, CHANGE YOUR TESLA PASSWORD IMMEDIATELY.
    
    # export tesla_email=joeshmo@gmail.com
    # export tesla_password=teslapass
    # Please also provide your vehicle's VIN, so TeslaUSB can keep the correct
    # vehicle awake.
    # export tesla_vin=5YJ3E1EA4JF000001
    ```
2. Boot it in your Pi, give it a bit, watching for a series of flashes (2, 3, 4, 5) and then a reboot and/or the CAM/music drives to become available on your PC/Mac. The LED flash stages are:

| Stage (number of flashes)  |  Activity |
|---|---|
| 2 | Verify the requested configuration is creatable |
| 3 | Grab scripts to start/continue setup |
| 4 | Create partition and files to store camera clips/music) |
| 5 | Setup completed; remounting filesystems as read-only and rebooting |

The Pi should be available for `ssh` at `pi@teslausb.local`, over Wifi (if automatic setup works) or USB networking (if it doesn't). It takes about 5 minutes, or more depending on network speed, etc.

If plugged into just a power source, or your car, give it a few minutes until the LED starts pulsing steadily which means the archive loop is running and you're good to go.

You should see in `/boot` the `TESLAUSB_SETUP_FINISHED` and `WIFI_ENABLED` files as markers of headless setup success as well.


### Troubleshooting

* `ssh` to `pi@teslausb.local` (assuming Wifi came up, or your Pi is connected to your computer via USB) and look at the `/boot/teslausb-headless-setup.log`.
* Try `sudo -i` and then run `/etc/rc.local`. The scripts are  fairly resilient to restarting and not re-running previous steps, and will tell you about progress/failure.
* If Wifi didn't come up:
    * Double-check the SSID and WIFIPASS variables in `teslausb_setup_variables.conf`, and remove `/boot/WIFI_ENABLED`, then booting the SD in your Pi to retry automatic Wifi setup.
  * If still no go, re-run `/etc/rc.local`
  * If all else fails, copy `/boot/wpa_supplicant.conf.sample` to `/boot/wpa_supplicant.conf` and edit out the `TEMP` variables to your desired settings.
* (Note: if you get an error about `read-only filesystem`, you may have to `sudo -i` and run `/root/bin/remountfs_rw`.


# Background information
## What happens under the covers

When the Pi boots the first time:
* A `/boot/teslausb-headless-setup.log` file will be created and stages logged.
* Marker files will be created in `boot` like `TESLA_USB_SETUP_STARTED` and `TESLA_USB_SETUP_FINISHED` to track progress.
* Wifi is detected by looking for `/boot/WIFI_ENABLED` and if not, creates the `wpa_supplicant.conf` file in place, using `SSID` and `WIFIPASS` from `teslausb_setup_variables.conf` and reboots.
* The Pi LED will flash patterns (2, 3, 4, 5) as it gets to each stage (labeled in the setup-teslausb script).
  * ~~10 flashes means setup failed!~~ (not currently working)
* After the final stage and reboot the LED will go back to normal. Remember, the step to remount the filesystem takes a few minutes.

At this point the next boot should start the Dashcam/music drives like normal. If you're watching the LED it will start flashing every 1 second, which is the archive loop running.

> NOTE: Don't delete the `TESLAUSB_SETUP_FINISHED` or `WIFI_ENABLED` files. This is how the system knows setup is complete.
